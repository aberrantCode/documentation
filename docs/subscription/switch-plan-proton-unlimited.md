# Switching from a SimpleLogin subscription to Proton Unlimited

On July 2022, [SimpleLogin announced the “Login with Proton” feature](https://twitter.com/SimpleLogin/status/1552254729148825600?s=20&t=cPBDO4sj71R86r9Nzu4H1A), allowing you to quickly create a new SimpleLogin account or to connect your existing SimpleLogin account using Proton SSO.

If you have a **Proton Unlimited, Business, or Visionary (legacy)** subscription, you can benefit from all **SimpleLogin premium** features for free as it is now included in your Proton plan.

That may result in 2 subscriptions if you already had a SimpleLogin subscription.

This article helps you to **1) connect your Proton** and SimpleLogin account  and **2) Cancel your current SimpleLogin subscription** to avoid being charged again during the renewal.

Before starting, make sure you have:

**a)** an active Proton Unlimited, Proton for Business, or Proton Visionary (legacy) plan.

**b)** an active, renewable SimpleLogin subscription. This includes subscriptions with credit card or PayPal (via our partner Paddle) or via Apple in-app purchase. Subscriptions with cryptocurrency (via Coinbase) or via coupon codes aren’t concerned.

### **1. Connect your Proton to your SimpleLogin account**

1. Log in to your SimpleLogin account and go to [Settings > Connect with Proton](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/setting#connect-with-proton)
2. Click **Link account**
