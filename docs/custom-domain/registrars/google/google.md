## (Optional) Add TXT record on Google Domains for SPF

Setting up SPF is recommended if you plan to send emails from your aliases. It'll reduce the chance your emails ending up in the recipient's Spam folder.

On Google Domains, click on "Create new record" button, then add the following TXT record:

![](./spf-record.png)

Leave the "Host name" empty and use `v=spf1 include:simplelogin.co ~all` as "Data".

Go back to SimpleLogin and click on "Verify", the SPF should be now verified.

## (Optional) Add CNAME record on Google Domains for DKIM

Similar to SPF, setting up DKIM is recommended if you plan to send emails from your aliases. It'll reduce the chance your emails ending up in the recipient's Spam folder.

On Google Domains, click on "Create new record" button, then add the following CNAME record:

![](./dkim-record.png)

Use `dkim._domainkey` as "Host name", `dkim._domainkey.simplelogin.co.` as "Data".

Go back to SimpleLogin and click on "Verify", the DKIM should be now verified.

## (Optional) Add TXT record for DMARC

Once you have SPF and DKIM set up, setting up DMARC is recommended to even reduce further the chance your emails ending up in the recipient's Spam folder.

On Google Domains, click on "Create new record" button, then add the following TXT record:

![](./dmarc.png)

Use `_dmarc` as "Host name", `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s` as "Data".

Go back to SimpleLogin and click on "Verify", the DMARC should be now verified.
